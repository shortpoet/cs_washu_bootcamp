There are many more rides, fares and drivers in urban areas (Urban $39k, 1625 fares; Rural $4.3k, 125 fares).  Fares (Rural $34 per ride, Urban $24 per ride) tend to be higher in rural areas both per ride and per driver (Rural $8 per driver, Urban $0.66 per driver), probably due to longer distances and fewer drivers servicing the areas (Rural 4 drivers per ride, Urban 36 drivers per ride). The data clusters representing individual cities are more tightly packed in urban areas meaning this data is more similar to its cohors, versus rural areas which are more disparate to each other.  Suburban areas fall in the middle in terms of analysis in all fields.
